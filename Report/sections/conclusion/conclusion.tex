It is necessary to be aware of the used algorithms. We had to ensure that our tools are properly configured, since most tools uses legacy encryption standards per default. Most of the legacy standards are now considered to weak to provide the protection needed by a modern application.  The problem with the MD5 algorithm is an example of security weaknesses that should be avoided. All in all we achieved securing the web server with appropriate security mechanism.
