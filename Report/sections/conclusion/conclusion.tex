\section {Conclusion} %bjoern

In future work we should be a little more aware of the algorithms we are using. Even though we are using state of the art tools in order to achieve wanted protection, the tools also may support legacy encryptions standards. We need to make sure this tools are properly configured to make sure that we provide the security intended. The problem with the MD5 algorithm is an example of security weaknesses that should be avoided. Next time we should use a stronger digest algorithm like sha-512 for instance.
