\section {Conclusion} %bjoern

In future work we should be a little more aware of the algorithms we are using. We need to make sure that our tools are properly configured, since most tools also supports legacy encryption standards. Most of the legacy standards are now considered to weak to provide the protection needed by a modern application.  The problem with the MD5 algorithm is an example of security weaknesses that should be avoided. Next time we should use a stronger digest algorithm like sha-512 for instance. Other than that it we achieved securing the web server with appropriate security mechanism.
