\subsection {Part 3: Writing a PHP application}


\noindent
In part 3 we have made a small PHP application with several functions. It is possible to login to the site using username and password and sessions are used to remember logged in users. Users can be added by the staff our by group members. Furthermore it is possible to download this report in an restricted area. \newline

\noindent
In order to realize this website we had to install PHP on the apache webserver. We used the official PHP manual to do this \cite{phpinstall}  and tested our PHP engine with the phpinfo() function.\newline

\noindent
Afterwards we created a usertable with username, password and an ID as primary key  in the MySQL database for our project. After these small preparations we were able to start with programming the PHP application.  \newline

\noindent
On the login page we used a cookie to store the username which is helpful for the user when he wants to login several times from the same device. After a successful login we are setting up the session variables. The use of sessions is also comfortable for the user since he has not to login again when he is visiting the site again from the same device without a previous logout. Logged in users  are allowed to download the report file. The signup page is only accessible for users with valid ssl certificate. On this page certified group and staff members and can add or delete users.
