\subsection {Part 2: Access control and Apache}

In order to be able to develop and run a simple Webpage it is necessary to install and configure a webserver. 
We are using  the Apache HTTP Server, release 2.4.3. This software is downloadable as tar archive from mirrors 
which are listed on the official apache website [quelle1]. To ensure that the downloaded archive is neither manipulated 
nor corrupt a pgp signature is offered on the apache website. 
\newline
\noindent
{\bf Q2. Explain what you have achieved through each of these verifications.
What is the name of the person signing the Apache release?}
\newline

The verification of this signature proves the integrity and the authenticity of the downloaded data, 
whereby the check for the latter shows, that this release is signed by Jim Jagielski, 
one of the founders of the Apache Software Foundation. 
\newline

The installation of the server software is pretty simple and is descriped in the official Apache Documentation [quelle2].
After the installation it is necessary to configure the server and to set the right filepermissions. 
We configured the server in a separated file group09.conf which gets included by the common httpd.conf. 
We are using two virtual hosts, the first is listening on port 8141 and arranged for plain http access to our application.
The second one is listening on port 8142 and requires SSL over http. 
Furthermore some parts of the application should only accessible for certain, 
well known persons and one well known group of people. To be able to realize this, 
the webserver is configured to check the used certificate of a visitor. 
If this certificate refers to one of these persons or to the group access is granted, 
otherwise a visitor would get an SSL error page.

\noindent
{\bf Q3. What are the access permissions to your web serverâ€™s configuration files,
server certificate and the corresponding private key? Comment on possible
attacks to your web server due to inappropriate file permissions.}
\newline


\noindent
{\bf Q4. Web servers offering weak cryptography are subject to several attacks.
What kind of attacks are feasible? How did you configure your server to prevent such attacks?}
