\subsection{subversion}
\noindent
Certainly a solution with authentication via SSL certificates would have offered a stronger security but our group decided to use the mentioned method with good passwords. The reason for this is that one of the group members is travelling a lot and often works on other PCs than his own. Therefore he would have to carry his certificate to any of this devices which probably could be malicious since they are operated by other people. Furthermore in case of using a flash-device containing the certificate there is the danger of losing it.
So basically there would be in our case a higher risk to disclose the certificates unintentionally.
However a weak protection of the subversion system is a huge threat to the webapplication itself. If an attacker would be able to get the access he can read and alter the sourcecode of the application. Reading it allows the attacker to find vulnerabilities much easier and altering could be used for a lot of harmful attacks and things like backdoors. Nevertheless the changes being commited by an attacker have to be updated on the server to affect the website and hopefully the updating person would check the file.
